### Kubernetes Manifest Validation Failure in CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline failed during the 'Validate Kubernetes Manifests' workflow. The error occurred while validating the `argocd-apps/apps.yaml` file.

**Error Details:**
```
error validating "argocd-apps/apps.yaml": error validating data: failed to download openapi: Get "http://localhost:8080/openapi/v2?timeout=32s": dial tcp [::1]:8080: connect: connection refused
```

This indicates that the validation process attempted to connect to a Kubernetes API server running locally on `localhost:8080`, but the connection was refused.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Trigger the CI/CD pipeline for the repository.
2. Observe the validation step in the 'Validate Kubernetes Manifests' workflow.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Ensure the Kubernetes API server is running and accessible on `localhost:8080`.
- Verify the `kubectl` configuration.
- Consider bypassing schema validation temporarily with `--validate=false` if it's not essential.
